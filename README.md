This is 99% the code of Mathew Bolan's LattiCG: https://github.com/mjtb49/LattiCG

I have slightly adapted it, so it reverses the RNG of Pokemon Showdown instead of the RNG of Java.

The only code from me is in https://github.com/MyrenEario/LattiCGforPokemonShowdown/tree/master/src/pokemon/pokemonshowdown
